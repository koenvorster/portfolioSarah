int the process of creating a portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills. 
The website will be built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, with a focus on performance and user experience.
My name is Sarah and I am a software engineer with a passion for web development.
I have experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies.
I am currently working on a portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills.
The website will include sections for my projects, skills, and contact information.
The goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio website that effectively showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The website will serve as a digital resume and a platform to share my work 
with potential employers and collaborators.
