I learned about different technologies, collaborated with talented colleagues, and gained valuable insights into the industry. One of the highlights was working on a project that involved building a web application from scratch. It was a great learning experience, and I am grateful for the support and guidance I received throughout my internship." +

But what made RoboCup truly unique were the robot soccer matches. Robots competing on the field, each programmed to work as a team and score â€“ it was a fascinating spectacle! The way the robots move tactically and communicate with each other to score a goal really showed me how far technology has come. It was a great mix of sport and technology, giving a new dimension to what is possible with robotics." ,
